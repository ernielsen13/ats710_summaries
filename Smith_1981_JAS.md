*Summary:*

This paper serves to investigate the cyclostrophic adjustment of an idealized tropical cyclone in one, two, and three layer models to the removal of mass (i.e., inducing convection by cloud seeding). The main motivation behind this study is the hypothesis by Simpson and Malkus (1964) that by seeding the eye-wall convection you reduce the horizontal pressure gradient, thereby causing the cyclone to adjust cyclostrophically and reduce the maximum tangential winds. However, this strategy is problematic as shown by Rosenthal (1974). Another motivating strategy involves seeding the storms outside the radius of maximum winds to create a second eye-wall, thereby cutting off inflow and weakening the inner eye-wall. Further, this would weaken the overall winds by angular momentum conservation, since the air is ascending at a larger radius. 

The simplified model equations used in this study are based upon a cyclostrophic and hydrostatic axisymmetric vortex. Furthermore, it is assumed that the vortex is in the vertical in a shallow layer of fluid with constant density and free slip upper boundary. The radial motion given by the set of equations is what is required to keep the vortex in cyclostrophic and hydrostatic balance as it adjusts to the mass extraction (an other applied torques not considered here). 

For the one layer model, it is found that if the mass is extracted (i.e., heating from convection/cloud seeding) is outside the radius of maximum winds the maximum tangential wind will decrease. Conversely, if the heating is within the radius of maximum winds the maximum tangential winds increase. Experiments were carried out where mass was extracted at 1.15 times the radius of maximum winds. At radii less than where the heating is applied the radial flow is outward, but two orders of magnitude smaller than the response radially outward from where the heating is applied, which leads a negligible reduction in the maximum tangential wind. At the radii larger than that of the heating, the radial flow is inward, which leads to an increase in the tangential wind in this region. When the mass extraction is distributed over some radius (i.e., 0.95 to 1.15 time the radius of maximum wind, as opposed to a point as above), there is an increase in tangential wind because the radial flow is inward at the radius of maximum winds. However, the changes in the maximum wind speed are very small. It does serve as a counter point to the hypothesis by Simpson and Malkus (1964), since when mass is extracted it is replaced by radial convergence which serves to strengthen the storm and no local reduction in pressure is seen. 

The results in the two and three layer versions of this model are similar to one another but different than the one layer model. At radii outside of the radius of mass extraction radial inflow is present in the lower levels and radial outflow at the upper. The tangential wind tendency is of opposite sign to the radial flow in each layer. When heating is outside the radius of maximum winds, inflow occurs at the lower layer at all radii, which increases the maximum tangential winds. This is in contrast to the one layer model. However, as in the one layer case the induced tangential and radial wind tendencies are two orders of magnitude weaker inside the seeding radius, regardless where the heating (i.e., mass extraction occurs). This study provides further support that the idea presented by Simpson and Malkus (1964) would not be effective.
