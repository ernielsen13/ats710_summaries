**Summary:**

The overarching goal of this paper is to analyze the moisture and precipitation evolution of storms during tropical cyclogenesis using polar-orbiting passive microwave instruments. Various models of tropical cyclogenesis are discussed with the results, and the spatial patterns of column water vapor and rain rate during the incipient stages of the storm are analyzed.

The study makes use of an approximately 20yr long dataset of passive microwave brightness temperature data from the SSM/I and SSMISS instruments that have been flying near continuously on the DMSP polar orbiting satellites over the period. The microwave data allows for the retrieval of column water vapor (CWV), rain rate, and other variables in regions that do not have traditional surface based observations. CWV was also used to calculate the saturation fraction (SF) or column relative humidity. The dataset of potential incipient tropical cyclones was obtained from the pouch-track dataset developed by Wang and Hankes (2014). The authors focused on the three days leading up to genesis, which is defined by the beginning of a track in the best-track archive. A total of 164 Atlantic storms were identified as viable for this study, after removing storms with a nonnegligible north-south propagation speed. Storm center composites of the microwave data for a 5 degree radius around each storm are created and matched to the nearest 6-hourly reference period. 

Precipitation, in a area mean sense, was found to be weak and scattered in the radial direction at genesis lead times greater than 48 hrs, but begins to organize from that point onward. Starting at 24 hrs before genesis (hereafter the notation will represent time before genesis with a minus, e.g., -24 hrs), the precipitation maximum moves to pouch center and increases substantially (from ~ 1 mm/hr to 2 mm/hr), especially within 6 hours of genesis. This provides the strong latent heat release to drive the secondary circulation and spin up the system. From a 2D point of view, the precipitation originally is maximized from -72 hrs to -36 hrs south of the pouch center, which is related to the ITCZ, located south of pouch center, serving as a moisture source to the deepening wave. By -18 hrs precipitation has become more symmetric, increased in magnitude, and is located near the pouch center. This falls in line with the Wang (2014) developmental model, but does not necessarily prove/disprove the Zehr (1992) model. 

Mean CWV over the pouch decreases as you move outward from the pouch center, which implies that the pouch can effectively retain moisture lofted by convection. Mean CWV values do not change as much as rain rate over time, but an increase is seen near -42 hrs. Initially, the CWV is maximized south of the pouch, which is believed to be associated with impacts from dry midlatitude air or the Saharan air layer. Larger CWV values are seen to encompass the center of the pouch by -18 hrs, but the northwest quadrant remains relatively dry outside of the incipient storm center. 

Previous research has shown that precipitation increases exponentially with CWV after some critical value over the normal tropical oceans. Using the passive microwave retrievals, the authors found that when precipitation rate was stratified by CWV higher rain rates for a given CWV were seen within the pouch compared to the mean tropical Atlantic atmosphere. However, when rain rate was stratified by saturation fraction a nearly identical exponential increase in rain rate after some critical value was seen in both ensemble groups. This suggests that the higher rain rates associated with the pouches occur in regions with higher saturation CWV (i.e., higher temperature regions). Analysis of saturation fraction histograms shows that convection in a developing tropical cyclone has a better chance at being near or above criticality. This is thought to be associated with a positive feedback between low-level moisture convergence and convection, which, in turn, suggests that convection is in a quasi-equilibrium state between high rain rates and high saturation fraction.

Some caveats do exists with the interpretation of the microwave data used in this study. First, the composite technique used here likely smooths out small-scale and non-steady state (i.e., more transient) features that are theorized to be important. Further, while microwave data is useful in examining the evolution of both precipitation and moisture, data in high precipitation regions is less reliable.
