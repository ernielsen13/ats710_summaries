**Summary:**

The main purpose of this study is to examine maximum potential intensity (MPI) using an empirical relationship derived from observations. A 31-year sample of Atlantic storm is used to compare the observed intensity to climatological sea surface temperatures (SSTs).  The empirical results are then compared to Emanuel (1988) and various aspects of the data examined. 

Tropical cyclone best track data in 6-hr intervals for the Atlantic basin was used from 1962 to 1992, due to the lack of consistency in the observation record before 1962. Over the record minimum sea level pressure of the storms was not consistently reported. For this reason, the empirical relationship is based on the maximum sustained surface wind evaluated in storm relative coordinates. The dataset contains a total of 257 tropical cyclones that yield 7110 6-hr observations. When stratified by SST, 3% of the cases line in the 15-20C range, 15% in 21-25C range, and 82% in the 26-30C range. 

The variation (i.e., difference between 50th percentile and maximum of the data) in maximum observed surface wind speed is much larger for SSTs greater that 26C (See Fig. 1 from paper). This variation is no longer present, however, when the SST is averaged over the last 12-hr period, which points to a somewhat lagged relationship in storm decay when it moves over cooler SSTs. The empirical exponential fit for determining maximum sea surface wind speed as a function of SST that was fit to the observational data had an average difference of 2.3 m/s. This exponential fit will be referred to as (MPI) for the remainder of the summary. A sensitivity analysis of the use of climatological or monthly mean SSTs was performed. It was found that differences of less than 1C were seen in 98% of the points (the mean anomaly was near zero), which means climatological SSTs can be used as input to the function. The authors then used Emanuel (1988) to determine the relationship between SST and outflow temperature, using their empirical function as the input for maximum wind speed. The results show a steep decrease in outflow temperature as SSTs increase for 24C. This shows why the empirical MPI depiction, based on observations, is so sensitive to SSTs between 26-29C. 

Most storms are well below their MPI, which, in this study, is partially because the entire life cycle of the storm is taken into account. Most storms reach their maximum intensity on the western side of the Atlantic and very close to the coast in the Gulf of Mexico. The average relative intensity (i.e., largest percentage of MPI researched by each storm) for the sample is 55% (58% if those with land effects were removed). In the distribution there are local maximums at 30% and 70% with a minimum at 60%. Looking at a cumulative distribution function of the relative intensity 51% (58% without land) of case reached 50% of their MPI, while on 16% (19% without land) reached 80% of their MPI. Relative intensity was generally higher for storms the further north and west they were. Furthermore, little difference in relative intensity was seen from August to November, but it is lower from June to July. In other words, early-seasons storms achieve, in general, a lower percentage of their MPI (could be explained by SSTs peaking in the Atlantic in early September). There is significant interannual variability across the period in the annual average relative intensity achieved by that seasonâ€™s tropical cyclones. More storms were seen and a higher mean relative intensity was achieved in westerly QBO years, in La Nina (or neutral) years, and in years where there was a positive precipitation anomaly in the Sahel region of West Africa. A sensitively analysis was performed to see how much cooling, according to the MPI theory presented here, would be needed to increase the relative intensity of the storms to 100%. The majority (i.e., 70%) of the cases needed over 4C of cooling to increase the relative intensity. 

The empirical formula for MPI presented here incudes implicit relationships between SST and outflow temperature. The results could be further generalized by determining relationships to different oceanic and atmospheric parameters using additional observations.
