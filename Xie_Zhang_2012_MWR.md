**Summary:**

The goal of this paper is to examine the dyanmics and predictability of the record setting rainfall that occured on Taiwan as a result of Morakot in 2009. The specific focus is to qualify the predictability of the typhoon track and precipitation, the enhancement of the orographically induced rainfall, and the interactions between the monsoon and Morakot. 

The authors used WRF with two, two-way-nested domains with the resolution of the inner most domain being 4.5 km. The model contained 34 vertical levels on a stretched grid, used WSM6 microphysics, and no cumulus scheme. Further, the model initial conditions were taken from a real-time global data assimilation system that contained 60 ensemble members. A total of three members (i.e., 15, 23, and 54), plus the control, from the data assimilation system were used for sensitivity experiments in this study.  

The control simulation captured the overall precipitable water, synoptic patterm, and synoptically induced low-level jet that was seen as Morakot made landfall. Furthermore, the cyclone-scale characteristics are also well represented by members 15 and 23. The control run, member 15, and member 23 all forecasted the landfall within 25 km. However, there were noticeable track errors as Morakot moved toward Taiwan. The sharp nothward turn after landfall was also captured by these three members. These same three simulations repreduced the peak intensity within ~10 kt, but underpredicted the storm's central pressure. Member 15 underestimated the total rainfall, while the control run and member 23 overestimated the rainfall. Further, the swaths were too far south in the control run and member 15. Member 54's track was so far north that it missed Taiwan all together, and it produced less than 500 mm of rainfall. 

Examining the entire 60 member ensemble, it is seen, not surprisingly, that the accuracy of the predicted rainfall is directly related to the accuracy of the storm track. Members 15 and 23 are two of the most accurate in the ensemble both in terms of track and rainfall. Two experiments were performed to examine the impacts of terrain. In one, Taiwan was moved 160 km south in the control run so that the storm completely missed the island. In the other, Taiwan was moved 200 km north in member 54 so that the storm hit the island. In experiment involving the control run, the storm takes a large southwestward turn, compared to the best track, when it approaches where the Taiwan would have been. In the case where Taiwan is moved so member 54 makes landfall on the island, the landfall location is approximately the same relative to the location the storm actually made lanfall on the island before it was moved. However, it slows down much more compared to the best track. 

Another set of experiments was undertaken for the control, member 15, and member 23 where the island was completely removed from the simulations. In the control when the island is removed, the distribution of rainfall is more spread out, but is still located on where the southern part of Taiwan would have been. It also produces 45% of the total rainfall observed, even without the terrain. Similar results are seen with the same runs but for members 15 and 23. The main precipitation region is located downshear left in these simulations, which is consistent with previous literature on precipitation asymmetry in TCs. Another set of experiments, where the island was made flat, show similar results to where the island was removed all together. While the point maximum in these simulations are lower, the area average precipitation is nearly equal to that when the topography is included. This means that the terrain leads to the redistribution of precipitation, but does not lead to more water being extracted from the atmosphere. 

A set of simulations was also carried out where the topography on the island was reduced by 50%. In these runs, the area averaged precipitation was again about the same as the runs that did not include topography. However, the these runs produce 30% less precipitation over the island than the full topography runs. However, this number varies quite a lot over the control run, member 15, and member 23. This implies there is a non-linear relationship with the terrain height/slope and the storm track. A 1-D idealized precipitation rate forecast model using the WRF data was found to explain the upslope rainfall distribution quite well. See the paper for model specifics. Lastly, is was found that the strength of the southwesterly monsoon flow can enhance the mesoscale circulation of an approaching typhoon near Taiwan by leading to stronger convergence and moisture transport near the island.
