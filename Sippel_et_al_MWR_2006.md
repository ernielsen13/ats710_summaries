**Summary:**

The overarching goal of this paper is to examine the formation of Tropical Storm Allison using a potential vorticity (PV) framework. Specifically, the authors use this framework to analyze various mesoscale vortices that were observed in Tropical Storm Allison (2001) while it was in range of land-based radar.  The superposition and generation of PV from background synoptic scale, mesoscale convective vortices (MCVs), and individual vortical hot towers (VHTs) was shown to be important. 

The environment where Allison formed was undergoing destabilization from a combination of synoptic scale processes. Increased return flow was seen around a high-pressure system over the eastern U.S. aided in providing the needed moisture and instability for the initial convection to develop. Further, the superposition of an upper and lower-level PV anomaly provided synoptic scale ascent and further destabilization. Additionally, these features provided the needed background vorticity for processes such as stretching to occur. An added bonus of the vertical superposition of the upper and lower-level PV anomalies was also to reduce the wind shear in the region. 

The only source of PV that was available in this region after the superposition of the synoptic scale PV anomalies was widespread deep convection of various scales. Thus, the overall meso-alpha-scale circulation associated with Allison was the result of system-scale convection PV generation and superposition. Several meso-beta-scale vortices (but not only MCVs) of various strength and longevity were also observed during the genesis of Tropical Storm Allison and were tracked by both radar and satellite imagery. It was noted that the meso-beta-scale vortices in Allison were stronger at lower levels when they were accompanied by active convection and stronger at midlevels when the convection waned, which makes sense based upon our understanding of convective/stratiform latent heating profiles. Many meso-gamma-scale vortices were also observed to be embedded within the convection and meso-beta-scale systems in Allison. Some of the low-level rotation rates were as strong as Great Plains mesocyclones. The meso-gamma-scale vortices that were observed tended to either dissipate or become ingested into larger scale convective clusters. 

At a very basic scale, a hurricane is a warm core, balanced vortex associated with a anomalously high column of PV. This PV is generated within organized updrafts of a similar scale and/or the merger PV anomalies at various vertical levels generated by smaller scales. In Tropical Storm Allison strong mid to low-level vortices were present at a variety of scales. The superposition of PV generally took place at the meso-beta-scale by also might have occurred from meso-gamma to meso-beta scale. Due to observational limitations, it is difficult to know how much of a role meso-gamma vortex merger played in the development of larger scale vortices in Allison; however, one example of this was seen. Regardless, the meso-gamma-scale vortices were an important source of PV generation for the large-scale (i.e., meso-alpha-scale) vortex. *“With multiple vortices (at multiple scales) possibly participating in tropical cyclogenesis, a single mode of development may not exist.”*
